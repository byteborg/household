This is a bed I built for my daughter, Hannah
Basically, it's built around a grid derived from the footprint of
the wooden beams. See the parameters in the OpenSCAD file.
The construction and design is loosely based on the forms of Gerrit
Rietveld's furniture (thanks Finn, for pointing this out).

The BOM and hand-annotated construction plan is for 58x58 beams.

!!! important note !!!
The OpenSCAD file currently miscalculates the length of the short beam
at the entrance - and I'm too lazy to fix this, as I already built the bed.
You're welcome to fix it a send me a patch.
